# Overlay Source (CS 1.6 ESP Overlay)

This folder contains the source code for the transparent overlay used to draw ESP boxes over the game.

## Notes

- The overlay reads `C:\Users\Public\esp_data.json` generated by the DLL
- It uses GDI API for drawing
- Use `Extreme Injector` or similar to inject the DLL into CS1.6

### Dependency: JsonCpp

This project uses [JsonCpp v1.9.6](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/releases/tag/1.9.6) for reading and writing JSON files.  
All rights belong to the original authors of JsonCpp.
The course will teach you how to setting JsonCpp in detail.

# Main CS 1.6 cheats Source 
This is part of the **"How to Make Your First ESP"** project. The DLL module is responsible for reading game memory from **Counter-Strike 1.6**, extracting enemy/player data such as position, distance, team, and status, and writing it to a JSON file that can be used by an external overlay.

# Note
More details will be introduced in the course.
