# Overlay Source (CS 1.6 ESP Overlay)

This folder contains the source code for the transparent overlay used to draw ESP boxes over the game.

## How to Compile

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Create a new "Windows Desktop Application" (Empty Project)
3. Add `overlay.cpp` to the project
4. Link the following libraries:
   - `dwmapi.lib` (for transparency)
   - `jsoncpp` if you are using it

5. Make sure the subsystem is set to `Windows` not `Console`

## Notes

- The overlay reads `C:\Users\Public\esp_data.json` generated by the DLL
- It uses GDI API for drawing
- Use `Extreme Injector` or similar to inject the DLL into CS1.6
